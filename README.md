If we want to build an entirely understandable tech stack (as part of
[civboot.org](http://civboot.org) or [bootstrappable.org](http://bootstrappable.org))
we need a language which can be implemented easily, has excellent expressiveness
and readability, can modify itself, and has a simple but effective security
model built in. The language has to be able to unroll from simple beginnings
(implemented in a hex editor or similar) to a full-featured language that we can
use to build a Civboot -- and have fun in the process!

That language is fngi, a language inspired primarily by FORTH and C. It is
implemented in a miniscule amount of C (fewer than 2-3k lines) and contains all
the bells and whistles you might want from C, as well as an absurdly powerful
macro system that can mutate it's own syntax at runtime -- literally it can
built itself into a new programming language while it runs.

Fngi itself has the following space targets:

- >=128KiB microcontroller/processor: can bootstrap a text-based OS providing
  human-editable source and assembly that can be recompiled on the
  microcontroller (aka self-bootstrapping). The processor does _not_ need to
  have memory-mapping, thread management, etc -- it can be a very bare-bones
  device.
- >=4KiB microcontroller: can run pre-compiled spor assembly. Will not be
  self-bootstrapping.

## Building
You need the 32 bit toolchain to build fngi (to use `-m32` flag in gcc).
On ubuntu this is installed with `sudo apt-get install gcc-multilib`

You then need the source code for the below repos in a single directory.
use either the ssh or http forms below
```
cd ~/my_personal_project_directory/
git clone git@github.com:civboot/fngi.git  # https://github.com/civboot/fngi.git
git clone git@github.com:civboot/civc.git  # https://github.com/civboot/civc.git
git clone git@github.com:civboot/cxt.git   # https://github.com/civboot/cxt.git
git clone git@github.com:civboot/zoa.git   # https://github.com/civboot/zoa.git

cd fngi
make test
```

## REPL
You can open a very basic REPL with:

```
make test ARGS=--repl
```

Example repl sesion:
```
\ Note: this is a line comment
\ put 0xF1 and 2 on the stack (stack is in hex)
\ After the colon is the types
0xF1 2
> {       F1        2} : S S

\ add the top of the stack to 9
+ 9
> {       F1        B} : S S

\ drop the working stack
drp drp
> {} :

\ define a function that multiples input by 2
\ TODO: input types
pre fn mulTwo stk:S -> S do ( * 2 )
mulTwo(4)
> {        8} : S
```

## Motivation
Fngi is a "macro first" language. Why? So that it can evolve to be whatever is
needed of it.  To understand this better, go back to early programming
languages: unix had sh and C.

Unix sh is barely a language. It has only a single type, the string.  It has an
extremely obtuse syntax who's sole method of operation is to dynamically execute
scripts and modify strings. In truth, the shell "syntax" depends on a host of of
other complex syntaxes: awk, grep, regexes, individual command lines, formats of
system files (`/proc/`), etc.

By contrast, C has a rigid syntax, a complex macro system, a complex build and
linking system and and no dynamic features. You could never use C as a
scripting language, since it has no way to execute a function you just defined.

What if there could be only one _base_ language, and you could use it as a seed
for more application-specific instances? It would have to be dynamic, but also
compile to a VM bytecode which can be executed immediately, but can also be
built into a native executable. If we are following in the footsteps of sh, it
should also be extremely small and simple in it's beginninings.

The first thing to note about fngi is that it has a **concrete syntax**. This
means there is no (inherent) abstract syntax tree -- every token is simply
compiled or executed immediately. In fngi, any function can declare itself as
`syn` (syntactical) and take control of its own destiny, reading tokens and
doing with them whatever it wishes. With great power comes great
responsibility. This leads to a radical "macro first" language, where language
features can be added by modules and imported as-needed.

## Goals

fngi's goal is to evolve into nothing less than the primary programming language
and operating system for [Civboot](http://civboot.org). There are many steps
along the way, some of them complete.

- [X] Make a complete fngi language, then throw it away. See
  [round_two](./notes/round_two.md)
- [x] Create [civc] library to build on top of, based on lessons learned
- [ ] Create fngi
  - [X] spor VM for executing compiled instructions
  - [X] TyDb for setting up the type checker
  - [X] fn for writing type-checked functions
  - [X] if/elif/else for flow control
  - [x] blk to create loop/while/etc.
  - [x] var, struct
  - [x] compilePath to compile source
  - [ ] global
  - [ ] `mod` to set the current dictionary path (module support).
- [ ] Create standard library
  - [ ] Allocator options and allocator stack
  - [ ] String formatting
  - [ ] String printing
  - [ ] Regex
  - [ ] File reading and modification
  * [ ] zoa integration
- [ ] Create an ultra-basic text-editor (zat)
- [ ] Extend zat to create an ultra-basic CLI
- [ ] Implement a tyStk (type checking) and hook into `fn`, `if`, etc
* [ ] Implement a better shell (shrm)
- [ ] Design and build a cross-compiler to compile spor -> IR -> native assembly
- [ ] Create an embedded operating system (RISC-V, ARM, etc)
- [ ] Create custom (stack-based) hardware and port the operating system

See [civboot.org](http://civboot.org) for future goals.
