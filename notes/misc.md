# Misc. notes

## Endianness

Little/Big endian do NOT refer to which "end" is the "big" (aka most
significant) byte. In fact, they have the reverse meaning as that.

They are reference to the Liliputans from Gulliver's travels.

The "Bigendians" broke the big side of the egg (number) over their head
(array-start). Hence a bigendian system has the large part of the number at the
head of the array.

Conversely, "Little Endian" liliputans broke the little side of the egg
(number) over their heads (array-start) and hence have the little part of the
number at the head.
